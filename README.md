# TestNG Testing Framework
TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit covering a wider range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc., with more powerful and easy-to-use functionalities. 
It is an open source automated testing framework; where NG of TestNG means ‘Next Generation’.

The main advantages of TestNG over JUnit are :

- Annotations are easier to use  and understand.
- Test cases can be grouped more easily.
- TestNG allows us to create parallel tests.
- We can pass additional parameters to annotations.
- Annotations are strongly typed, so the compiler will flag any mistakes right away.

The TestNG testing framework can execute your tests in parallel. It can also execute some function just before or right after your tests.
